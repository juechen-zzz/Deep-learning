# Hello 

In this part, I will learn about deep learning by watching Andrew Ng's lessons online.

* First，I will systematically learn about data structures and algorithms.
* Second, I will save some notes about Python.
* Third, I will put some deep learning examples.
* In order to see the pictures, please replace the “C:\Users\nihaopeng\Deep Learning\images\” to “../images/”
